/**
 * Where this app lives, for links that leave it.
 *
 * Password resets, invitations and anything else opened from outside the
 * browser tab need an absolute URL. Building one from the request's own host
 * header is right for the request and wrong for the email: a reset asked for
 * on a dev server emails a link to localhost:3000, which is correct at the
 * moment it is made and useless by the time it reaches a phone. That is how
 * this was found, on the POS build.
 *
 * The host header is also attacker-controlled. A request carrying
 * `Host: attacker.example` would otherwise produce an email that is genuinely
 * ours, correctly signed, carrying a valid one-time token, pointing at
 * somebody else's server. Vercel rejects unknown hosts before they reach this
 * code — but that is a security property borrowed from the host, and it
 * disappears the day this runs anywhere else.
 *
 * So in production the origin must be a host we own. In development it is
 * whatever was asked for, because localhost there is what was meant.
